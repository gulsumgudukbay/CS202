READMEThe filestream reader that I wrote for the generateTree method did not work, so I took the string input as a normal string instead of a file stream read string. Therefore, I commented out the filestream reader generateTree method and wrote a new one to read a normal string. When running the program, the main method should be changed in order to change the input, since the file cannot be read.
