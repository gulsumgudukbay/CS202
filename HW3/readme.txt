Since my main method is in a separate cpp file, to compile the code, g++ main.cpp heapsort.cpp heap.cpp -o heapsort should be written, or else it won’t locate the main. However, since there is a Makefile file that already does the compilation, calling the make command will be sufficient in order to compile the cpp files. The run command works the same as presented in the homework task.
